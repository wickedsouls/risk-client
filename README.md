# RISK Game Online
## The front end application for the multiplayer game

### Rules
 This is a multiplayer game with maximum of 6 players. Players gather in the waiting lobby where they create or join the games. Once the game has started, world map is loaded and everyone is given random lands. The goal is to conquer the world by any means!
 
It's a turn based game. Every turn players accumulate armies bases on the lands they have. On their turn they can 
place armies on their lands, attack others and move armies. Attacks are made by rolling dices where defender has an 
edge versus the attacker.

Conquering the continent gives extra armies to the player and additional cards that you can exchange to armies.
